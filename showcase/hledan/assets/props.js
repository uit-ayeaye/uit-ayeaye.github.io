/**
 * Street furniture for the junction.
 *
 * The map is a photogrammetry capture merged into eight meshes — every building,
 * vehicle and kerb is welded into one of them, so nothing in it can be moved or
 * rescaled individually. What it lacks is the layer of small stuff that actually
 * makes a Yangon street read as Yangon: the plastic-stool tea shops on the
 * pavement, the vendor umbrellas, the roadside water-pot stands, the YBS buses
 * nosed into the traffic. That layer is added here instead, procedurally.
 *
 * Everything is authored in **metres** and multiplied into map units by
 * WORLD_SCALE at build time, so these are the only objects on the map whose
 * real-world proportions are correct by construction rather than by measurement.
 *
 * Placement is baked, not random. The anchors below were derived offline from
 * the map itself: the road surface (`Road_final`) and the building footprints
 * were rasterised into occupancy grids, then vehicles were placed on road cells
 * with a long enough straight run to hold them, and pavement props on cells that
 * are next to a building but not on the carriageway. Baking keeps load cost at
 * zero and — more importantly — keeps the layout identical every visit, so it
 * can be art-directed and tested rather than re-rolled on each load.
 *
 * Cost: one InstancedMesh per prop type, no textures, no shadows. Nine draw
 * calls for ~290 objects.

/* Twenty-seven of these vehicles used to stand in the dark.
 *
 * The occupancy grid that placed them was rasterised from above, so it could
 * not tell a stretch of open carriageway from the same stretch with a flyover
 * eighteen units over the top of it. Five buses and twenty-two taxis landed in
 * the underpass — a fifth of the fleet, in the one part of the map no light
 * reaches and no viewpoint looks at — while the deck itself, seven hundred
 * units of four-lane road, carried no traffic at all.
 *
 * They now stand on the deck. Each y is the deck surface measured by casting
 * down onto it at that exact x/z, and each yaw is the deck's own heading there,
 * sampled twenty units either side; the anchors sit eight units off the crown,
 * which is a lane either side with six units of deck still outboard of the
 * body. Which vehicle got which slot is not arbitrary either: the low tier
 * keeps every second taxi and the first eleven buses, so the seven that survive
 * that thinning were spread along the deck first and the rest filled in between
 * them — otherwise a phone showed a queue at the south end and an empty bridge.
 *
 * Six more had only part of a body in the deck's shadow — a bus beside a pier,
 * a taxi at the mouth of the ramp with six units of headroom. Those went
 * sideways instead, to the nearest stretch of Road_final with no deck within
 * three units of the bodywork and no other vehicle within a bus length.
 *
 * ObstacleField already banded its boxes by height for exactly this map, so the
 * collision moved with them: the underpass is walkable again.

/**
 * The lamp posts the MAP already carries.
 *
 * The photogrammetry mesh has real posts baked into it — the tall highway
 * lamps down the flyover deck, and a scatter of masts along the western
 * avenue — and they never lit, because the merged mesh has no per-object
 * anything. Erecting new procedural stands beside them doubled every pole, so
 * only the LIGHT is added: a lens where the fixture is, a pool on the surface
 * beneath it, and a halo. Rows are the LUMINAIRE — [x, y, z, groundY] — not
 * the post, because a highway lamp's fixture hangs off an arm five units to
 * one side and a bulb drawn at the pole top glows in mid-air beside the dark
 * fixture it is meant to be lighting.
 *
 * **Every row here was measured against the geometry, one at a time.** Both
 * halves of the list needed it:
 *
 *  - The flyover's fourteen are one repeated model carrying exactly 96
 *    triangles, so clustering the deck's lamp-head band and keeping the
 *    96-triangle blobs finds all of them and nothing else. Within each blob
 *    the post is a 5-triangle column at one end and 53 of the 96 triangles
 *    sit in the outer fifth of the arm — that dense far cluster IS the
 *    luminaire, and its underside is at y 72.53. The previous rows sat ~0.7 u
 *    short of it, on the bare arm, which is why the bridge read as balls
 *    floating beside their lamps.
 *
 *  - The street-level rows came from scanning the baked height field for thin
 *    spikes, and that method cannot tell a lamp from a fence post, a sign or
 *    a bump in the terrain. Tested against the mesh, **28 of the original 40
 *    had no usable vertical structure under them** — six had nothing whatever
 *    within three units, in any direction, at any height. They were bulbs hung
 *    on nothing. Those are gone. The twelve that survive each stand on a
 *    column of at least ten triangles running unbroken from the ground, and
 *    sit on that column's own axis and top rather than at a guessed height.
 *
 * Street lighting is not thinner for it: the 44 procedural poles in POLE carry
 * their own lamps and cover the same avenues.

 * The lamps a vehicle carries, as their own geometry so they can be driven to

 * vehicle's own transform list — the SAME array object, not a replayed PRNG —
 * so they cannot drift off the bodywork. See `layout()`.
 *
 * **Both models already say where their lamps go, and these are those places.**
 * The car is untextured, so `loadVehicleGeometry` baked its material colours
 * into vertex colours: filtering for the amber (163,77,26) and the red
 * (163,19,15) picks the headlight and tail-light panels straight out of the
 * mesh. The bus keeps its palette texture instead, so the same question is
 * asked of the UVs — the triangles whose UV lands on the palette's orange
 * (255,153,21) are its headlight cluster. Each patch is then split by the sign
 * of x to give a per-side centre.
 *
 * That is a world away from the figures this replaces, which were reasoned
 * from nominal dimensions and were wrong in both directions at once: the bus's
 * headlight panel sits at z 5.648 where the old 5.58 buried the lens 7 cm
 * INSIDE the bodywork — and a depth-tested additive lens inside a solid draws
 * nothing, so the entire fleet ran with no headlights at all — while the car's
 * are at 1.986 where the old 2.06 hung both of them clear of the bumper with
 * the road showing through the gap.
 *
 * `hs`/`ts` are the slope of the panel across the lens, dz/dx, taken from the
 * same patch. A stock low-poly car noses in fast — the headlight panel loses
 * 73 cm of z per metre of x — so a flat lens wide enough to read as a
 * headlight cannot lie flush on it. Shearing by that slope lets the lens keep
 * a believable width and still follow the panel it is set into.
 *
 * The bus has no tail lamp modelled anywhere, in texture or geometry, so those
 * two are placed by measurement instead: its rear panel is flat at z -5.646
 * right across the width at that height.
 *
 * This is most of what makes the road read as alive after dark: 84 vehicles is
 * 84 pairs of headlights and 84 pairs of tail lights, and at a junction this
 * size that is the whole picture.

 *
 * The obvious fix — cut each layout into XZ tiles and let three.js reject whole

 * genuinely visible, and a mobile driver would rather transform a hundred
 * thousand vertices than change state a hundred and twenty extra times.
 *
 * So the culling is done per INSTANCE instead, on the CPU, by compacting the
 * visible ones to the front of the instance buffer and shortening `count`.
 * Draw calls stay flat in every view, the overview still draws everything
 * because everything is genuinely on screen, and at street level nine tenths
 * of the work disappears. A sphere-vs-frustum test is six dot products, so the
